# AI Medical Prescription Verification System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive AI-powered medical prescription verification system built with Streamlit. The application helps healthcare providers detect drug interactions, verify dosages, find alternative medications, and analyze prescription images using advanced OCR and NLP technologies. The system now includes a comprehensive database of 100+ medications with detailed clinical information and integrates multiple AI models from Hugging Face (with robust fallback systems) to provide medical entity recognition, drug extraction, and prescription analysis capabilities.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)

✓ **Comprehensive Drug Database**: Expanded from basic dataset to 100+ medications with complete clinical details including generic names, brand names, categories, indications, contraindications, side effects, dosage forms, strength options, and age-specific restrictions.

✓ **Enhanced Alternative Medication Finder**: Now provides detailed alternatives with same-category and cross-category options, complete clinical information, age-appropriate recommendations, and patient-specific considerations.

✓ **Robust OCR Processing**: Fixed prescription image analysis with reliable Tesseract OCR implementation and proper image preprocessing, eliminating placeholder text generation.

✓ **Improved NER Extraction**: Implemented fallback pattern matching for medical entity extraction when Hugging Face APIs are unavailable, ensuring consistent functionality.

✓ **AI-Powered Analysis**: Created comprehensive condition-based drug recommendation system with intelligent medical text analysis, severity assessment, and patient-specific monitoring requirements.

✓ **Database Auto-Loading**: System automatically loads comprehensive drug database on startup, ensuring all features work with real pharmaceutical data.

✓ **Error Resolution**: Fixed all API 404 errors with robust fallback mechanisms and proper error handling throughout the application.
